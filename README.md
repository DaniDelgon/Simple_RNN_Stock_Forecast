# Simple_RNN_Stock_Forecast
In this project, the knowledge acquired about RNNs will be applied to train models that are capable of predicting the behaviour of the time series. To do so, a temperature dataset will be used to predict the future values of the time series through the application of RNN. We will see how modelling using RNN is a very good option in these cases of time series.
