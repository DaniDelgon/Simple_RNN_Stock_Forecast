# Simple_RNN_Stock_Forecast
In this project, the knowledge acquired about RNNs will be applied to train models that are capable of predicting the behaviour of the time series. To do so, a temperature dataset will be used to predict the future values of the time series through the application of RNN. We will see how modelling using RNN is a very good option in these cases of time series.

We can see that as a result of this miniproject, our model have learning some patterns of this stock and have some acceptable just by training it with the closes prices of the stock we are studying. But we can further improve this forecasting with some finance feature engineering, by training this model with candle data, MACD... instead of solely training it with the close price, but as a proof of concept, the results just with the Close prices are acceptable.
